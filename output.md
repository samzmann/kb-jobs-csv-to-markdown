**Importance:** 🔥 Event critical (aka This MUST be done for KB to happen!)

Toolhouse needs you! 
Did you know that KiezBurn provides manual and power tools for the general build, dreams and more? 

Well we do. To make this smoothe, we need a new Tool-Bitch (or king/queen/princess/slave ...) who shares the role with our current Tool-Queen Leo.

You're the person for this job if you are
- capable and knowledgeable of handling power tools in a safe way, including maintenance such as replacing chain saw chains, auger bits and so on
- have 1 or 2 days capacity pre burn (asap) to research replacement bits and pieces, shop in hardware stores and coordinate this with the budget person, as well as do some small repairs (also possible during build)
- are available during build and best case also strike for 2-4 hours a day (flexible) to sit around in the sun and handing out tools, yelling at underworld to bring the ladder back, helping tool-newbies to handle them safely and signing lists.
- extra points if you are tall and strong (tools in storage are above head lifting) and can support in organizing getting the tools to site (coordinating with transport lead or bringing them yourself or helping Leo to bring them)

Safety third 😉
